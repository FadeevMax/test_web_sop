WEBVTT

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.830
<v David Peck>Hey. Hello?

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.430
<v David Peck>Can.

00:01:38.255 --> 00:01:41.455
<v Milos Milovanovic>Can you hear me? I can. Can you hear me? Yep. Cool.

00:01:43.055 --> 00:01:48.175
<v David Peck>Alright. So in my mind is, 3 things. Just

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:48.815
<v David Peck>checking in.

00:01:52.335 --> 00:01:52.335
<v David Peck>What's.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.770
<v David Peck>How's it going with the max stuff? Like, what what do you see is, like where's the value creation, that

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.250
<v David Peck>sort of thing?

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.210
<v Milos Milovanovic>Yeah. I mean, that was disappointing not to get the the I was really expecting the AR team to

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.915
<v Milos Milovanovic>show up today. It's, I guess, Stephanie was sick. Katarina is MIA.

00:02:16.675 --> 00:02:18.995
<v David Peck>So, yeah, that was sorry?

00:02:19.715 --> 00:02:24.770
<v Milos Milovanovic>Cat problems. I think Stephanie Stephanie is sick, but

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.250
<v Milos Milovanovic>I don't know.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.010
<v David Peck>If Stephanie's sick. Katarina has cat problems, but if you don't think that you wanted from

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.690
<v David Peck>them, I can probably give it to you.

00:02:34.225 --> 00:02:39.665
<v Milos Milovanovic>Got it. It was more of, like, just bouncing ideas off of them and and just getting a getting a better

00:02:39.665 --> 00:02:45.025
<v Milos Milovanovic>understanding of, like, what's in the dashboard, what are all the because. Max and I are looking to export. We're

00:02:45.025 --> 00:02:50.140
<v Milos Milovanovic>looking at the export of of all the metrics that are in in the AR dashboard, and the way

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.740
<v Milos Milovanovic>it was exported is, like, metrics are repeating themselves multiple times, and like, there's

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.815
<v Milos Milovanovic>clearly different tables where the same metric shows up in different tables, so we, like,

00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:05.855
<v Milos Milovanovic>we want them to give us context on what the different tables are and

00:03:05.855 --> 00:03:11.055
<v Milos Milovanovic>just to look at our idea for the chatbot to see how that aligns with the dashboards. But

00:03:11.055 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Milos Milovanovic>timing for them to to commit to showing up

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.790
<v Milos Milovanovic>next week. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.230
<v David Peck>Good, and then otherwise, how's it what's the list with this that sales ops thing?

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.015
<v Milos Milovanovic>Yeah. We have a little a meeting on the books with Dushan and tomorrow to review the

00:03:30.015 --> 00:03:35.295
<v Milos Milovanovic>latest chatbot. We've spent the most time on this today because

00:03:35.295 --> 00:03:40.575
<v Milos Milovanovic>I would like this to be, like, kind of game time ready and and usable.

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:45.690
<v Milos Milovanovic>But, the biggest challenge to overcome now is, like, the image

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Milos Milovanovic>retrieval, because they want the chatbot to reply with images

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Milos Milovanovic>that are, like, like, screenshots that Teodora took, and they're part of the SOP, and they show,

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.035
<v Milos Milovanovic>like, some important stuff. So that's something that

00:04:01.035 --> 00:04:06.075
<v Milos Milovanovic>we're that we've been working through today, and then also, like, we have a list

00:04:06.075 --> 00:04:11.115
<v Milos Milovanovic>of we compiled a list of questions for them and requests how to make the doc better so

00:04:11.115 --> 00:04:12.235
<v Milos Milovanovic>the chatbot works better.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.040
<v Milos Milovanovic>But there was, like, a little bit of I mean, there's things that Max has

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.240
<v Milos Milovanovic>been doing that's like he did it with Claude Code, and Claude Code kind of figured it out, and

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.055
<v Milos Milovanovic>he doesn't really truly understand how it works. So it's like reverse

00:04:29.055 --> 00:04:34.095
<v Milos Milovanovic>engineering it and writing a spec spec sheet together today

00:04:34.095 --> 00:04:37.775
<v Milos Milovanovic>to just, like, structure it, basically. And.

00:04:38.415 --> 00:04:44.820
<v David Peck>We see he doesn't understand how it works. Which aspect does he understand? You mean, like, the underlying sales ops process? The.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.900
<v Milos Milovanovic>Retrieval. Like, the the the technical aspect of, like, how does the how how does

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.420
<v Milos Milovanovic>the AI retrieve? Like, there's 3 scoring, formulas that

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.955
<v Milos Milovanovic>Claude Code came up with, based on how how it it will retrieve images. So,

00:05:01.955 --> 00:05:07.075
<v Milos Milovanovic>like, one is the image label. Like, it's just gonna look at the exact match of the image label

00:05:07.075 --> 00:05:12.515
<v Milos Milovanovic>based on what the query in the chat was. One was, like, context context

00:05:12.515 --> 00:05:17.530
<v Milos Milovanovic>retrieval. So, like, basically, is the text around it does

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.650
<v Milos Milovanovic>does that make sense with the image, and there's a few of these scoring rules, and that just got

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.850
<v Milos Milovanovic>baked in into some, like, JSON file, and Max just kinda ran with it but didn't really understand.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.385
<v Milos Milovanovic>Like, without really understanding those rules, we can't troubleshoot them. We can't understand, like,

00:05:33.385 --> 00:05:39.145
<v Milos Milovanovic>why are the images the image replies are wrong. For a lot of the the

00:05:39.145 --> 00:05:44.185
<v Milos Milovanovic>queries that we put in, the image replies are wrong, which I think a a large part of this is gonna just come

00:05:44.185 --> 00:05:45.580
<v Milos Milovanovic>down to, like, better labeling. But.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.900
<v David Peck>What's the what is there a workaround? I mean, I guess I don't understand why we why do we

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.300
<v David Peck>need images?

00:05:57.685 --> 00:05:57.685
<v David Peck>I.

00:05:59.045 --> 00:06:04.325
<v Milos Milovanovic>Was also asking the same question. Theodora has clearly put in a lot of hours into, like,

00:06:04.325 --> 00:06:10.540
<v Milos Milovanovic>building this SOP, and then she believes the images like, some images basically provide the

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Milos Milovanovic>context that the team needs, and she, like, did red squares and arrows that

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Milos Milovanovic>she wants to things.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Milos Milovanovic>Yeah. Like,

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.070
<v Milos Milovanovic>things like this?

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.390
<v Milos Milovanovic>What?

00:06:52.605 --> 00:06:55.485
<v David Peck>That's a table. It's it's an image it's an image of a table.

00:06:57.325 --> 00:07:01.360
<v David Peck>Yeah. My original.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.520
<v Milos Milovanovic>Plan was to, like, basically turn all of this into Markdown.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.640
<v Milos Milovanovic>But they really and I my my ultimate

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.415
<v Milos Milovanovic>goal is, like, I want them to be happy with the outcome, and I think even replies learning

00:07:18.415 --> 00:07:23.455
<v Milos Milovanovic>how to do image replies is helpful. But it has turned out to be, like,

00:07:23.455 --> 00:07:25.535
<v Milos Milovanovic>a bigger rabbit hole than I expected.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:36.380
<v Milos Milovanovic>But, yeah, we do I mean, the chatbot is replying with images. A lot of times, it's

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:41.500
<v Milos Milovanovic>correctly replying. But if there's, like for example, there's this case. I

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.625
<v Milos Milovanovic>think it was oh, yeah. Nevada tips and tricks. Like, here, the images don't have labels

00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:52.785
<v Milos Milovanovic>underneath them, and they're like so for in this case, it wasn't retrieving correctly. But

00:07:52.785 --> 00:07:57.850
<v Milos Milovanovic>I think yeah. I probably Max was too deep into

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:03.530
<v Milos Milovanovic>just, like, figuring the sub by himself or like, adapting to

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:08.650
<v Milos Milovanovic>what's in the doc without changing anything, which I think it's like, we just have to get that sales ops team to

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.410
<v Milos Milovanovic>add a label under each image.

00:08:13.285 --> 00:08:15.925
<v David Peck>Yeah. That makes sense.

00:08:19.285 --> 00:08:24.325
<v Milos Milovanovic>Well, that that's been one of the things that we also he built actually, this is helpful

00:08:24.325 --> 00:08:29.650
<v Milos Milovanovic>to I mean, it's like the first actual

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:36.850
<v Milos Milovanovic>live chatbot on a website that he built. Where

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:37.250
<v Milos Milovanovic>is it?

00:08:41.525 --> 00:08:44.645
<v Milos Milovanovic>Oh, it's not that. Screen search.

00:08:51.285 --> 00:08:52.005
<v Milos Milovanovic>Did you delete it?

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:04.540
<v Milos Milovanovic>There we go. So this is, like, an actual live site with it's

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:04.780
<v Milos Milovanovic>like.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:13.795
<v Milos Milovanovic>I mean, this is terrible, so we have to work on making this better. Well, Vedrana was we were showing

00:09:13.795 --> 00:09:15.715
<v Milos Milovanovic>this Vedrana because she stopped by the office.

00:09:19.395 --> 00:09:19.715
<v Milos Milovanovic>Oh, interesting.

00:09:23.635 --> 00:09:28.660
<v Milos Milovanovic>So maybe something is wrong currently or something. Anyway, we

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:33.700
<v Milos Milovanovic>were we were kinda brainstorming ideas how to make this better and push it

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:38.980
<v Milos Milovanovic>to the website because I think, again, the discussion is

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:44.065
<v Milos Milovanovic>that people are currently monetizing some really silly things, and the industry

00:09:44.065 --> 00:09:49.505
<v Milos Milovanovic>is nascent. So the the goal is to just go live with this and keep

00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:54.800
<v Milos Milovanovic>upgrading it with, like, the image generation and get a better UI that's

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Milos Milovanovic>gonna and then also, like, help by help dispensaries by adding

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.120
<v Milos Milovanovic>an attachment. So, like, we talked about huge dispensaries, MSOs. They get thousands of

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.675
<v Milos Milovanovic>new strains every week. Like, the power play is upload a CSV file of 1,000 strains

00:10:10.675 --> 00:10:15.875
<v Milos Milovanovic>and just get get it populated inside of the sheet. Like, get all these stats populated inside

00:10:15.875 --> 00:10:20.850
<v Milos Milovanovic>of the sheet instead of, like, manually searching each one. Okay. Makes sense.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.690
<v David Peck>So the sales ops thing, like, what's a query that they wanna do?

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:35.245
<v Milos Milovanovic>How do we how what's the order limit in in Maryland, or

00:10:35.245 --> 00:10:40.365
<v Milos Milovanovic>how do we split orders in Nevada, and usually, like,

00:10:40.365 --> 00:10:45.485
<v Milos Milovanovic>the order split rules are different for RISE stores versus general stores because they have

00:10:45.485 --> 00:10:48.125
<v Milos Milovanovic>different I mean, they they obviously treat their own stores as, like, they give them preferential treatment.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:56.910
<v Milos Milovanovic>Better pricing, better, like, higher order or higher order limits and stuff like that. So,

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:02.030
<v Milos Milovanovic>like, each state has its own rules for, like, what are the limits, how

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:07.715
<v Milos Milovanovic>do you input orders, do do batteries go on a different invoice? Do they not? There's

00:11:07.715 --> 00:11:12.915
<v Milos Milovanovic>all these nuances, and they also break down by by state and

00:11:12.915 --> 00:11:17.950
<v Milos Milovanovic>then break down by regular orders and rise orders. So,

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:22.110
<v Milos Milovanovic>like, non non GTI owned stores versus GTI owned stores.

00:11:30.765 --> 00:11:36.045
<v Milos Milovanovic>The way I see it, the basis of a sales order entry agent, like, this

00:11:36.045 --> 00:11:42.125
<v Milos Milovanovic>is what is the, like, the rules that

00:11:42.125 --> 00:11:42.765
<v Milos Milovanovic>it should follow.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.750
<v David Peck>Oh, I see. I see. I see. I see. I see.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:56.990
<v Milos Milovanovic>Because the next step is then add the tool use, figure out how to hook it

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Milos Milovanovic>into leaf tree, I mean, ideally.

00:12:03.175 --> 00:12:03.415
<v Milos Milovanovic>I think.

00:12:05.575 --> 00:12:10.615
<v David Peck>Why don't you look into this? Because I think you're gonna end up in a rabbit hole of

00:12:10.615 --> 00:12:15.970
<v David Peck>trying, like, of a lot of edge cases. What about if you

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.490
<v David Peck>guys looked at let's take one state, like, just New Jersey.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:28.195
<v David Peck>And look at what are the most common things that we do in New Jersey and

00:12:28.195 --> 00:12:33.555
<v David Peck>just figure out how to automate those. Right? Because if you try to do what you're talking about,

00:12:33.555 --> 00:12:38.595
<v David Peck>which is a wide, you're trying

00:12:38.595 --> 00:12:43.600
<v David Peck>to go wide, and you're saying and you're trying to have it work for all different markets, for all different

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:49.040
<v David Peck>use cases, which is going to be necessarily very difficult. So

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:54.715
<v David Peck>I think a simpler way to do it is if you narrow down to just New Jersey, just

00:12:54.715 --> 00:13:00.955
<v David Peck>GTI, and just the things they do all the time. In

00:13:00.955 --> 00:13:01.355
<v David Peck>New Jersey?

00:13:02.235 --> 00:13:07.275
<v Milos Milovanovic>Yes. Got it. Like, repetitive tasks that they do in New

00:13:07.275 --> 00:13:07.915
<v Milos Milovanovic>Jersey. Okay.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:15.080
<v David Peck>Rather I think that's a good Rather than you're, like, you know, trying to get and

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:20.280
<v David Peck>just start there. Right, and so it's like and then and then it's a better conversation. It's like, hey. Sales

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:25.385
<v David Peck>ops team, we automated this piece. You don't have time to go and label all these other things we need so you can kinda move on

00:13:25.385 --> 00:13:26.105
<v David Peck>to the next step.

00:13:28.025 --> 00:13:32.505
<v Milos Milovanovic>Okay. That makes sense. I think that's a good item for to to discuss tomorrow. Okay.

00:13:36.025 --> 00:13:36.905
<v David Peck>What time is that meeting?

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.230
<v Milos Milovanovic>I think it's 7AM PST.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:43.510
<v Milos Milovanovic>07:30.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:47.110
<v David Peck>Okay. Perfect. Invite invite me to that, and is there an agenda going up beforehand?

00:13:50.055 --> 00:13:52.775
<v Milos Milovanovic>There. I was meaning to send them a list of questions.

00:13:53.255 --> 00:13:57.415
<v David Peck>Yeah. Perfect. Oh, yeah. Just invite me so I can listen I can listen in.

00:14:02.055 --> 00:14:07.240
<v David Peck>And I would tell them this New Jersey thing so they can come prepared for that. Okay.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.080
<v David Peck>Got it.

00:14:44.785 --> 00:14:44.785
<v David Peck>Okay.

00:14:48.305 --> 00:14:51.905
<v David Peck>And then Daniella changing gears, how's she doing?

00:14:56.465 --> 00:15:01.550
<v Milos Milovanovic>I guess nothing major changed since our last call, but

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.110
<v Milos Milovanovic>I'm pushing her as much as I can. I mean.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:09.870
<v David Peck>Okay. So she come so her view, it's funny because she's seen things kinda like the same way you are.

00:15:15.705 --> 00:15:15.705
<v David Peck>Where.

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:23.865
<v David Peck>Let's see. Okay.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.680
<v David Peck>Okay. She said.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:05.990
<v David Peck>And she said this, which I thought was which I thought was sim which is good because it's similar to

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.630
<v David Peck>how you're thinking.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:30.410
<v Milos Milovanovic>I mean, this is like it's been hard for me to know what the next steps are, what the best okay. The best practices and

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.810
<v Milos Milovanovic>the documentation that I need to read, I get that.

00:16:37.745 --> 00:16:42.865
<v Milos Milovanovic>What are success metrics and so on? I mean, come on. Like, I've. I guess I.

00:16:42.865 --> 00:16:49.105
<v Milos Milovanovic>I guess I should communicate in that or Yeah. To, one

00:16:49.105 --> 00:16:54.140
<v Milos Milovanovic>big takeaway from working multiple accounts is that we needed to to create an internal SOP

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:59.180
<v Milos Milovanovic>of or service frameworks. For example, outlining what cleanup setup requires. I

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:03.980
<v Milos Milovanovic>agree. Like, all of this is needed, and I just feel like I need headspace to do it.

00:17:04.665 --> 00:17:09.945
<v David Peck>No. No. No. Not this isn't a no. The issue is I should just tell her, great. Can

00:17:09.945 --> 00:17:10.425
<v David Peck>you do it?

00:17:13.145 --> 00:17:18.460
<v Milos Milovanovic>You can't, but we could probably get started. But, yeah, my my frustration is, like, she likes

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:24.540
<v Milos Milovanovic>to send me these end of day reports, which is just like this text wall, and

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:29.580
<v Milos Milovanovic>like, can we sync tomorrow on the Happy Caps project? I need a clear order of priorities.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:34.935
<v Milos Milovanovic>So, like, that kind of a question is a junior question. Like,

00:17:34.935 --> 00:17:40.295
<v Milos Milovanovic>I and I responded, like, basically,

00:17:40.295 --> 00:17:46.450
<v Milos Milovanovic>like, please suggest an order of priorities based on the observance on the meeting yesterday. Like,

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:51.730
<v Milos Milovanovic>please challenge yourself to come back to me with suggested solutions. This is why you're on meetings. Like, she was on the meeting yesterday.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:54.610
<v David Peck>Okay. Great, and what she said?

00:17:55.970 --> 00:18:01.755
<v Milos Milovanovic>She ignored it, and she just, like oh, oh, she actually hasn't even replied yet. See?

00:18:01.755 --> 00:18:06.955
<v Milos Milovanovic>But she has, like, thumbs up another message. So she basically like, she's ignoring the

00:18:06.955 --> 00:18:13.810
<v Milos Milovanovic>hard advice, and she's just sort of trying to to

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:19.970
<v Milos Milovanovic>stay alive with what she's doing and formulate really nice

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:26.195
<v Milos Milovanovic>replies with Chad GPT. I guess that's that's her thing. I'm

00:18:26.195 --> 00:18:27.555
<v Milos Milovanovic>I'm being a hater, but.

00:18:29.075 --> 00:18:30.275
<v David Peck>I think my my.

00:18:31.555 --> 00:18:36.675
<v Milos Milovanovic>Plan is to my plan is to basically push push her to be

00:18:36.675 --> 00:18:41.710
<v Milos Milovanovic>the account POC. Like, her technical, like, marketing design and the

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:48.030
<v Milos Milovanovic>sense of design, sense of American culture, I think it's just lacking. Like,

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:53.310
<v Milos Milovanovic>it it just, like, even Minh, I would say Milan is a better, like, at at creating ads

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:58.315
<v Milos Milovanovic>than her at this point and and email creatives. So, like,

00:18:58.315 --> 00:19:03.435
<v Milos Milovanovic>I think she just needs to be pushed into the direction of being, like, the account the face of the account and

00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:06.315
<v Milos Milovanovic>communicate try to make her a communicator. And.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.710
<v Milos Milovanovic>Okay.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:15.710
<v David Peck>What could she do this week that would add value?

00:19:21.765 --> 00:19:22.005
<v David Peck>I mean.

00:19:23.525 --> 00:19:28.645
<v Milos Milovanovic>I've sent her a few things that she should be doing. Like, just focus on Happy Caps. It's

00:19:28.645 --> 00:19:35.240
<v Milos Milovanovic>a new client. Get as many assets from their Dropbox. If he has access to a big Dropbox, we

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:40.440
<v Milos Milovanovic>need to convert those assets. We discussed it for the meeting. Like, 9 to 16, we

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:46.120
<v Milos Milovanovic>want everything vertical to be and have a a safe zone, which is ultra important. Like,

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:51.225
<v Milos Milovanovic>safe the real safe zone. So it's like a square safe zone, and I told her

00:19:51.225 --> 00:19:56.985
<v Milos Milovanovic>to work with Milan and Elena to turn these images into videos and video ad concepts. Look

00:19:56.985 --> 00:20:02.345
<v Milos Milovanovic>at Milan's tasks and figure out how you can unblock, help him, curate music for

00:20:02.345 --> 00:20:05.065
<v Milos Milovanovic>ads based on the ICP doc that we filled out yesterday.

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:12.630
<v Milos Milovanovic>Like, just get get stuff moving. Like, get get ads ready, get, you

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:17.830
<v Milos Milovanovic>know, get Elena ideate, send Elena a concept that she can design. Look at,

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:22.985
<v Milos Milovanovic>you know, Milan. Milan's task post, which she's been, I think, stepping up and

00:20:22.985 --> 00:20:28.265
<v Milos Milovanovic>really granularizing and and planning out his tasks. So, like, you

00:20:28.265 --> 00:20:33.625
<v Milos Milovanovic>shouldn't be doing that stuff. I mean, you know, just maybe even just looking at Veronica's and Milan's tasks

00:20:33.625 --> 00:20:38.750
<v Milos Milovanovic>every day and like, chatting them and and seeing how she can help and accelerate them and

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:43.790
<v Milos Milovanovic>collaborate with them, like, learn through through that process. As opposed to, like,

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:48.830
<v Milos Milovanovic>I'm sitting on my ****, and I'm waiting for you to give me kind of, like, what what are the

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:54.245
<v Milos Milovanovic>priorities? What what should I do tomorrow? Okay.

00:20:54.245 --> 00:20:56.885
<v Milos Milovanovic>That's.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:09.940
<v Milos Milovanovic>But I think it that yeah. A lot of it was, like, setting expectations and and

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:14.980
<v Milos Milovanovic>the day day one intro clearly makes a lot of difference. There's another learning from Max.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:22.845
<v Milos Milovanovic>I'm like, this is not a 9 to 5 job and like, blah blah.

00:21:27.565 --> 00:21:31.325
<v Milos Milovanovic>Blah. I'm buffering. Give me a second.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.110
<v David Peck>Did you and we did we sign happy caps as a client?

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:44.310
<v Milos Milovanovic>I was following up with Catarina about that because I don't know if they signed the contract yet. Sounds

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:49.315
<v Milos Milovanovic>like they didn't, but she's also not respond I guess, learning that she has

00:21:49.315 --> 00:21:50.675
<v Milos Milovanovic>cat problems. But, yeah, I sent.

00:21:50.995 --> 00:21:56.195
<v David Peck>It's you did you resend them a Docusign? Yeah. Katarina did.

00:21:57.795 --> 00:22:02.980
<v Milos Milovanovic>I usually do it through Vedrana, but Vedrana was out, and Katarina was kind of in charge of your stuff that day. So I I

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:03.620
<v Milos Milovanovic>did it through Katerina.

00:22:14.945 --> 00:22:19.985
<v Milos Milovanovic>I was at like, I was asking, should we because I told Sean as well. Like, this guy hasn't signed

00:22:19.985 --> 00:22:25.105
<v Milos Milovanovic>yet. Like, should I don't think we should start working on his stuff.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:29.450
<v David Peck>What'd Sean say? Keep going. Who cares?

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:35.050
<v Milos Milovanovic>Yeah. He was like, oh, yeah. He's definitely down to go. Like yeah. Okay. I mean, I trust Sean.

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.530
<v David Peck>I do too. I think.

00:22:42.105 --> 00:22:47.385
<v Milos Milovanovic>Yeah, it's highly unlikely that we end up with, like, another happy Zendeskop flop with

00:22:47.385 --> 00:22:49.065
<v Milos Milovanovic>this. Happy Zendeskop.

00:22:52.105 --> 00:22:52.585
<v David Peck>Also grown.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:00.060
<v David Peck>Let's see.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:10.460
<v David Peck>He looked at it on the 24th and hasn't signed, so let's just resend it to

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:10.540
<v David Peck>him.

00:23:12.115 --> 00:23:17.235
<v Milos Milovanovic>Was that and was there another one sent? Because we were supposed to send another one because he was

00:23:17.235 --> 00:23:22.695
<v Milos Milovanovic>like, I don't wanna do. I think he he basically asked for a month to month. Huh,

00:23:22.695 --> 00:23:27.890
<v Milos Milovanovic>and then Katerina I sent Katerina the updated contract. I

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.170
<v Milos Milovanovic>don't know if that was sent.

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:36.530
<v Milos Milovanovic>Or maybe that's the slip through. It's like the follow up was never she was, like, very unresponsive.

00:23:40.345 --> 00:23:40.825
<v Milos Milovanovic>In last week.

00:23:43.065 --> 00:23:50.105
<v David Peck>Yeah. It's, yes. It's, it

00:23:50.105 --> 00:23:53.145
<v David Peck>is month to month. Was he okay. With the 5 k?

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.460
<v Milos Milovanovic>Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It's month to month. It's.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:04.860
<v David Peck>Initial term one month upon expiration. The initial term is free, which automatically for success of renewal terms of 4

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:10.035
<v David Peck>one month each. So yeah. So it is what he wanted. So

00:24:10.035 --> 00:24:11.875
<v David Peck>you can probably clarify that for him.

00:24:16.115 --> 00:24:16.115
<v David Peck>Okay.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:27.510
<v Milos Milovanovic>And and I, yeah, have a meeting with Embark later. So

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:32.795
<v Milos Milovanovic>I'll bring up the the scope. We've been getting a lot of, like, requests from

00:24:32.795 --> 00:24:37.995
<v Milos Milovanovic>them, from the agent guy that just keeps dumping stuff on us

00:24:37.995 --> 00:24:43.195
<v Milos Milovanovic>without any collaboration. So just we I will be calling that out as, like, we've just

00:24:43.195 --> 00:24:48.270
<v Milos Milovanovic>got a lot of, like, Alpineiq tasks, which, again, I think that's what I wanna make clear

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:53.550
<v Milos Milovanovic>is, like, we. Alpine isn't in our scope, but we

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:59.675
<v Milos Milovanovic>are, you know, happy to it's just like yeah. That's the that's

00:24:59.675 --> 00:25:03.115
<v Milos Milovanovic>the thing that kinda slowed us down additionally over this week.

00:25:04.795 --> 00:25:07.755
<v David Peck>Let me send her a note here. Where's the recording note?

00:25:33.855 --> 00:25:38.095
<v David Peck>Who's gonna be in that call? The everyone? Okay.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:47.940
<v David Peck>I would do it as a sidebar with Courtney not on +1 01 because that's that people are just gonna get defensive and

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:52.900
<v David Peck>weird, so there's no reason to do that. Just be like, hey, Courtney. Can we do a quick sidebar?

00:25:54.435 --> 00:25:59.635
<v Milos Milovanovic>That's I think makes sense. But the thing that happened was, like, on we got a request last week

00:25:59.635 --> 00:26:04.915
<v Milos Milovanovic>that got missed. I think it was, like, honestly, a douchebag request.

00:26:04.915 --> 00:26:12.260
<v Milos Milovanovic>Well, not douchebag request, but it was, like, it was sent on an Friday afternoon. But

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:17.300
<v Milos Milovanovic>there this request got sent, like, a few days earlier. It was like, hey. Can you make us 3 templates in

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:22.365
<v Milos Milovanovic>Alpine and send them out, and I got like, I spoke

00:26:22.365 --> 00:26:27.485
<v Milos Milovanovic>to her like, this was Veronica's miss because I spoke her about it, and she assigned her to it, and then she was

00:26:27.485 --> 00:26:32.605
<v Milos Milovanovic>supposed to chat Daniela to help, and that never happened. So, like, internally but I I think it's because, like,

00:26:32.605 --> 00:26:37.790
<v Milos Milovanovic>there's this layer of attraction for the team. Like, they don't know how to use Alpine. Like, they never used Alpine.

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:43.710
<v Milos Milovanovic>So, like, any task that involves Alpine is gonna take, like, additional brainpower

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.150
<v Milos Milovanovic>to figure out and do discovery and whatever.

00:26:48.845 --> 00:26:49.325
<v David Peck>Okay. Okay.

00:26:55.565 --> 00:26:59.565
<v Milos Milovanovic>Cool. So, yeah, I'm just kind of going through that and doing all the updates.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:03.010
<v Milos Milovanovic>Okay.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:12.850
<v David Peck>So they asked us to do something that we don't know how to do? Only that only you would know how to do, basically.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:19.565
<v Milos Milovanovic>No. No. It's fairly simple. It's like building templates and sending them out from

00:27:19.565 --> 00:27:24.605
<v Milos Milovanovic>an email platform, but it's a platform that the team doesn't really I mean, it's

00:27:24.605 --> 00:27:29.645
<v Milos Milovanovic>like, they can figure it out. It's not rocket science. It's just like that it's a different UI,

00:27:29.645 --> 00:27:34.710
<v Milos Milovanovic>and we like, I was trying to figure out, like, how do I how because they asked us, like,

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:42.070
<v Milos Milovanovic>can you upload a CSV into Alpine, and we haven't gotten these requests before, and

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:47.155
<v Milos Milovanovic>I couldn't figure out how to go up. Like, I thought we were just lacking access, because it's, like, it's a whole

00:27:47.155 --> 00:27:52.275
<v Milos Milovanovic>different thing, and it just takes time to build our

00:27:52.275 --> 00:27:52.435
<v Milos Milovanovic>own.

00:27:57.235 --> 00:28:04.430
<v David Peck>Okay. So there's just some just some wow. Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:09.550
<v David Peck>So I think what's your name is sort of right in that we do need some, like, here's what we

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:14.595
<v David Peck>do. Here's what we don't do. Just kind of internal and external documentation. So

00:28:14.595 --> 00:28:19.715
<v David Peck>it's like, no. We're not we don't Alpineiq. So, I mean, could we could

00:28:19.715 --> 00:28:22.515
<v David Peck>we put her on building this stuff that she's talking about?

00:28:23.955 --> 00:28:28.990
<v Milos Milovanovic>I tried. Like, just the her level of attention to detail and like, the

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:34.270
<v Milos Milovanovic>the entry or whatever you called is just so low. Like, I just that's

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:39.550
<v Milos Milovanovic>been really. I've been really struck by that. Like, she just. I mean, I

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:44.705
<v Milos Milovanovic>sort of I sent her a few few Slack messages, and I ended up deleting them. But, like, I just asked

00:28:44.705 --> 00:28:49.825
<v Milos Milovanovic>her, like, do you care? Can you just can you just let me know if you care? Because, like, I can work out

00:28:49.825 --> 00:28:55.370
<v Milos Milovanovic>for the tree puts out is, like, surface level work, and

00:28:55.370 --> 00:29:00.810
<v Milos Milovanovic>for this document, you really need to go deep and understand it and care to

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:06.570
<v Milos Milovanovic>write something meaningful. Like, she she

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:11.705
<v Milos Milovanovic>tries to cut through everything with AI, which is, like

00:29:11.705 --> 00:29:16.745
<v Milos Milovanovic>I guess it's a good mindset, but she is just like she will outsource every step with

00:29:16.745 --> 00:29:21.830
<v Milos Milovanovic>it to AI just to, like, I don't wanna think about this. Like, find the easiest way to

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.870
<v Milos Milovanovic>prompt LGBT to get this task done is, like, her mindset.

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:33.110
<v Milos Milovanovic>Anyway, I.

00:29:34.265 --> 00:29:40.825
<v David Peck>Okay. Alright. So longer conversation, but so you wanna keep should we just let her go and like, keep the money? Give

00:29:40.825 --> 00:29:43.145
<v David Peck>some of it to you for the for the trouble? I mean.

00:29:45.065 --> 00:29:50.130
<v Milos Milovanovic>I mean, I've had been it's been in the back of my mind till it's just like, is it better to hire two two

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:56.450
<v Milos Milovanovic>more juniors for that budget that she she's

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.490
<v Milos Milovanovic>taking up? So it's definitely on my mind. But.

00:30:03.105 --> 00:30:08.385
<v Milos Milovanovic>Yeah, I I guess we that's a conversation I would maybe I

00:30:08.385 --> 00:30:13.425
<v Milos Milovanovic>don't wanna say that it's like a threat of, like, just something to float as

00:30:13.425 --> 00:30:13.905
<v Milos Milovanovic>like, hey.

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:20.070
<v David Peck>Well, I think what you do is, if you don't mind, can I snippet part of this and send it

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:25.190
<v David Peck>to Jose and be like, hey? Could you please help us? Yeah. Cool. Alright. So

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:30.255
<v David Peck>I'll do that and like, see if he can help us because that's his job, and we'll see what he comes back with and

00:30:30.255 --> 00:30:35.455
<v David Peck>you know, that whole thing. Because it's like you you you shouldn't be miserable. I shouldn't be miserable. We're

00:30:35.455 --> 00:30:37.055
<v David Peck>all miserable. No one's winning here.

00:30:41.695 --> 00:30:46.680
<v David Peck>Got it. So. I.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.200
<v David Peck>Think that's the win there, and then I think it is probably.

00:30:59.505 --> 00:31:04.505
<v David Peck>Yeah, and I think don't look at it today, but I sent

00:31:04.505 --> 00:31:06.425
<v David Peck>you, like, a real AI problem for Mammoth.

00:31:07.865 --> 00:31:10.745
<v Milos Milovanovic>I saw that. Yeah. I saw the comment, Justin. I remember that.

00:31:11.465 --> 00:31:16.720
<v David Peck>I don't even I I don't even understand how to do it, but basically, where you wanna start looking is, like, 19 minutes

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:22.160
<v David Peck>is where they really they start talking about the real issue, which is basically, like, messy data

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:27.745
<v David Peck>coming out of the retailer's POS, and they don't really have a matching scheme to do it. So

00:31:27.745 --> 00:31:33.585
<v David Peck>they're trying to figure out how to use AI. She tried to use AI. This girl's really smart, and she failed. So,

00:31:33.585 --> 00:31:35.825
<v David Peck>clearly, it's a clearly, it's a real challenge.

00:31:39.025 --> 00:31:40.785
<v Milos Milovanovic>Okay. Yeah. I'll definitely look at that.

00:31:41.185 --> 00:31:46.310
<v David Peck>Yeah. So no rush on that. I'm not gonna hold you to it, but, that

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:53.750
<v David Peck>seems like something real. I will see you at tomorrow's thing. Please

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:54.710
<v David Peck>send them the agenda.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:32:01.535
<v Milos Milovanovic>Some Oh, yeah. I love yeah. I also have a queue Akila call tomorrow. Okay.

00:32:02.975 --> 00:32:03.535
<v David Peck>What time is that?

00:32:05.375 --> 00:32:10.575
<v Milos Milovanovic>At 9 09:30. Okay. With the ads guy and then on Thursday with the mail email

00:32:10.575 --> 00:32:14.330
<v Milos Milovanovic>guide. Alright. So I talked to their boss.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:20.970
<v David Peck>And the woman, and her take was like, she's like, look. I think you guys are really smart. We just don't want someone else,

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:26.410
<v David Peck>like, telling us what to do and like, giving a suggestion that also knows our bosses because

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:31.545
<v David Peck>that's gonna be really annoying for us. So I just positioned as like, no. No. We're

00:32:31.545 --> 00:32:36.585
<v David Peck>not gonna do that. Just give us, like, your just give us your, like, challenging work you don't wanna do,

00:32:36.585 --> 00:32:39.225
<v David Peck>and like, we'll figure out how to get it done for you. It's like our foot in the door.

00:32:40.825 --> 00:32:46.050
<v Milos Milovanovic>Got it. Got it. Yeah. That makes sense. I think I sort of positioned myself as

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:52.130
<v Milos Milovanovic>more like a cons consultant that will tell them what to do. Okay.

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:53.170
<v Milos Milovanovic>Cool.

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:55.970
<v David Peck>Alright. I'll talk to you soon.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:58.210
<v Milos Milovanovic>Right. Talk to you. Bye.

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:07.110
<v Milos Milovanovic>Can you hear me? Yes.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:14.550
<v David Peck>How's it going? Oh, good. They're they're back. They went to the park. Now they're back playing with the helicopter. Everything's going well. Oh,

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:14.950
<v David Peck>good.
